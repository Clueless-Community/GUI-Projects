#Python Tic Tac Toe – Develop a Game in Python
-----------------------------------------------------------
It’s no doubt, you must have played Tic Tac Toe in your school days and every one of us loves to play the game. You will be surprised to know that the game of Tic Tac Toe is known to exist since ancient Egypt times.

With this Python project by TechVidvan, we are going to build an interactive game of Tic Tac Toe where we’ll learn new things along the way.

What is Tic Tac Toe?
-----------------------------------------------------------
Tic Tac Toe is one of the most played games and is the best time killer game that you can play anywhere with just a pen and paper. If you don’t know how to play this game don’t worry let us first understand that.

The game is played by two individuals. First, we draw a board with a 3×3 square grid. The first player chooses ‘X’ and draws it on any of the square grid, then it’s the chance of the second player to draw ‘O’ on the available spaces. Like this, the players draw ‘X’ and ‘O’ alternatively on the empty spaces until a player succeeds in drawing 3 consecutive marks either in the horizontal, vertical or diagonal way. Then the player wins the game otherwise the game draws when all spots are filled.

Approach:
------------------------------------------
- Create a landing page containing selection buttons: Single-player or multiplayer.
- Create a game board containing nine tiles to play the game along with other details (i.e. playing with a system or another player, whose turn etc.).
- Allow the player to press the tile and check the status of the game (i.e. Tie game, anyone of the players won the match or the game is still running).
- Display the message, who won the match.
